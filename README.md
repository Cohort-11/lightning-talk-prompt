# Lightning Talk

## Overview

In this session, you will be presenting a topic of your choice to your classmates. You will be presenting your findings in the form of an informal [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk).


## How to select a topic

You can think about selecting a topic in two ways:

1. Select one topic that we have covered in the class so far or a general computer science/engineering topic.
2. Look for an interesting topic that we have not covered then think about how you can present it for the class.

## What is a lightning talk?

Think about your talk as a short pitch. It will be helpful to practice your talk beforehand! Keep it short, succinct and to the point.

For our purposes, a lightning talk is a talk lasting **no more than 5 minutes**.

You could prepare slides for your talk to help you explain. _But all slides will be shown from a single laptop._

**Time limits will be strictly enforced.**
